I used python venv command to create a virtual environment to store all my files



Now, I want to create the small sample blocks that can be re-used over and over to build something bigger: 

1. An Agent that connects to the internet 
2. An Agent that can call multiple functions like a toolbox 
3. An Agent that has 2 agents in it - 1 takes the input from the user and makes an output that is fed to a second agent which is then returned to the user
4. An Agent that can store data across multiple sessions 

This should complete all of the ways in which an agent can be used. 

After this, we need to look into building simple use cases that combine the above. These use cases will serve as proto-types to building something bigger 

Some ideas I have: 
1. Tool to search the internet and get news about whats happening in each country in different domains 
2. Tool that searches the internet and uses archive.is to unblock and retrieve information from the source
3. Tool that can do BODMAS 
4. Tool that can calculate bond details 


Once these are built, I can tackle big picture challenges such as: 
1. News source with viewpoints from all angles 
2. Stock news analysis on a daily weekly monthly annual basis 


Also make sure this is accessible from your tablet and phone.

I have noticed something. Quite a lot of news about specific companies like barrick gold is also published on X. 

it would be a good idea to track those.
